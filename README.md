# Email Examples

This is a repo of code examples for building better HTML email campaigns and templates.

That first sentence begs the question: *What is a better HTML email?* Better html emails are designed and coded with a few key principles kept in mind:

- **Simplicity:** The code is as simple as it can be to aid readability on the development side, rendering on the subscriber's side, and reduce artifacts from email client rendering engines.
- **Accessibility:** All of the code is written with accessibility as a key feature. An email’s content is available to—and its functionality can be operated by—anyone, regardless of ability. From a coding standpoint, this means relying on semantic markup, live text over images, appropriate alternative text for images when used, and a thorough understanding of how email campaigns are consumed by assistive technology.
- **Modularity:** The code is built in a modular fashion, so that each individual component can be plugged in anywhere—like LEGO pieces—without breaking the entire campaign. This allows faster, more scalable production, and reduced rendering artifacts. 

It's a working repo and may be updated frequently as techniques are adapted to the changing email landscape and new technologies are introduced that impact how we develop email campaigns.
